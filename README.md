# closest_pair
closest_pair is a program designed to compute the closest pair in d-dimentional space. The algorithm efficiency is between O(n) to O(log n).

Usage
-----
The MinCir function takes an GPS-coordinate-pair array as input, and will return the position (in the format of GPS coordinates) and radius (in meters) of the smallest circle.

Input: n-dimensional points list or set

Output: [closestDistance, closestPair]

For example:
```
import closest_pair
closest_pair.close_pair.test()
```
